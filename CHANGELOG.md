## [1.2.1] - 2025-08-26

### Fixed
- **Critical bug**: Bet creators can now properly join their own bets (take one side)
- **Emoji conflict**: Changed prop bet emojis from ‚úÖ/‚ùå to ‚¨ÜÔ∏è/‚¨áÔ∏è to avoid conflict with cancellation emoji
- **Reaction handling**: Fixed issue where valid reactions were being incorrectly removed
- **Creator participation**: Creators can now take one side of their bet but still cannot bet against themselves

### Changed
- Prop bet emojis updated: ‚¨ÜÔ∏è for Over/Yes (Side A), ‚¨áÔ∏è for Under/No (Side B)

- **Emoji-Based Resolution & Cancellation** - No typing needed!
  - Active bets now show üÖ∞Ô∏è (Side A wins), üÖ±Ô∏è (Side B wins), and ‚ùå (Cancel) emojis

  - Resolution tracking shows who voted for what outcome
  - Status updates in chat ("Player X voted Side A wins, waiting for Player Y...")
